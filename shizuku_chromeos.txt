This guide is for advanced users. 
Modifying system settings may void your warranty or cause instability. 
Proceed at your own risk.

Prerequisites
ChromeOS device (developer mode option 1 will be discussed here,
it probably isnt the only way from my experience.)

Android apps support enabled 

Basic familiarity with terminal commands

Steps
1. Enable Developer Options in Android Settings
Open Settings app

Go to Apps > Google Play Store > Manage Android preferences

Tap "Build number" 7 times to enable Developer options

2. Enable USB Debugging
In Android settings, go to System > Developer options

Enable "USB debugging"

3. Install Shizuku
Open Google Play Store

Search for "Shizuku" and install the app

4. Start Shizuku Service
Open Crosh (press Ctrl + Alt + T)

Enter shell to access a full shell

Run the following command:

text
adb shell sh /sdcard/Android/data/moe.shizuku.privileged.api/start.sh
5. Grant Permissions
Open Shizuku app

Follow on-screen instructions to grant necessary permissions

Usage
Shizuku is now ready for use with compatible apps

Some features may be limited due to ChromeOS restrictions

Troubleshooting
If Shizuku doesn't start, try rebooting your device

Ensure Android subsystem is up-to-date

Check Shizuku's official documentation for ChromeOS-specific issues

Remember, Shizuku's functionality on ChromeOS may be limited compared to standard Android devices due to system differences and restrictions
