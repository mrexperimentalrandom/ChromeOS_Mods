Chrome OS version 119 introduced restrictions 
on sudo usage in the Crosh terminal. 
  
This guide outlines a method to regain sudo access 
using SSH key authentication. The process leverages Chrome OS's 
built-in SSH server to create a workaround.

Prerequisites
A Chromebook in Developer Mode

Basic familiarity with terminal commands

Comfort with potential risks to system stability

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Enter VT-2 Terminal
Action: Press Ctrl + Alt + F2

Note: Some Chromebooks may use Ctrl + Alt + â†’ instead

2. Log in as chronos
Command: Enter chronos at the login prompt

Note: No password is required in Developer Mode

3. Generate SSH Key Pair
Command:

text
ssh-keygen
Tip: Accept defaults by pressing Enter at each prompt

4. Set Up Public Key Authentication
Command:

cat /home/chronos/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > /home/chronos/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
5. Configure SSH Daemon
Open config:

text
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Add/modify:

PubkeyAuthentication yes
HostKey /home/chronos/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Save & Exit: Ctrl + O, then Ctrl + X

6. Start SSH Server
Command:

sudo /usr/sbin/sshd
7. Return to Crosh and Log In via SSH
Access Crosh: Press Ctrl + Alt + T

SSH Command:


ssh localhost -l chronos -i /home/chronos/user/.ssh/id_rsa
8. Verify sudo Access
Test Command:

sudo echo "Success!"
If successful, you now have sudo privileges in Crosh

Best Practices and Tips
Security: Regularly update your SSH keys and monitor for 
unauthorized access attempts.

Convenience: Use this method for easier copy-pasting in 
Crosh compared to VT-2.

Reversibility: To undo changes, remove the added lines from 
sshd_config and restart your Chromebook.

Troubleshooting
If SSH login fails, double-check the sshd_config file for typos.

Ensure the SSH server is running with ps aux | grep sshd.

If issues persist, reboot your Chromebook and try again from step 1.

Conclusion
This method provides a powerful workaround for advanced Chrome OS users. 
Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. 
Use these privileges wisely and always prioritize system security.
