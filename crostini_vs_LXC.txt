No developer mode needed, just crosh > vmc start termina > chronos > lxc commands

I am also aware that Crostini can run Docker 
and be root user inside the Docker container 
of various Linux Distros, but I am writing about 
LXC today because this removes your dependence on 
Google for the base layer functionality of your 
Virtual Machine. 
The goal here is to isolate your new LXC container 
from the PENGUIN container. 
This can be done with LXC network commands. 
Id reccomend reading documentation on LXC 
before playing around too much.

Key Points Summary

Crostini:

Pros: Easy setup, seamless integration, user-friendly.

Cons: Limited customization, no direct root access.

Standalone LXC Containers:

Pros: Full control, privileged containers, flexible configurations.

Cons: Requires technical expertise, more setup involved.
